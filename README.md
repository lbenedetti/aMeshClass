# aMeshClass
aMeshClass is an implementation of a spatial discretization C++ class for numerical applications.

The objective is to create a very fast class (even cache-friendly if possible), to allow different numerical method to lookup for values (coordinates, topology of the mesh) in the fastest way possible.
